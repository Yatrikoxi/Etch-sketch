# Etch-sketch

Second project at the end of Fundamentals. HTML / CSS / JS

This project was mainly focused on practising and showing your DOM manipulation skills. 
Instead of generating fixed number of tiles, I went for slider that adjusts 
grid. Second function was to clear tiles with reset button, next was randomized coloring.

It took a lot of googling and watching guides, but in the end it came through.
As said in the curicullum - This was not meant to be easy task.

For CSS I mainly tried to stick to flexbox arranging. 

Hope you like this small app that is part of final projects of Foundations program in the Odin Project.
